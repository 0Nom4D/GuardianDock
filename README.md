GuardianDock is a multi-function app for Destiny 2.

GuardianDock goal is to provide a Destiny 2 player to access his stats at the same place:
- PVE Stats (Strikes, Regular and Grandmaster Nightfalls)
- PVP Stats (Crucible, Iron Banner, Trials Of Osiris)
- Raid / Dungeon Stat

## History

GuardianDock is an old school project developed with 2 friends: [EternalRat](https://github.com/EternalRat) and [TrueBabyChaise](https://github.com/TrueBabyChaise).

The project was a React Native app connected with random APIs for Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) for Warzone, Fortnite and Destiny 2.

The project knew a first wave of refactoring that I conducted alone but I didn't do much because I tried to make the app with TypeScript and React Native (again).
